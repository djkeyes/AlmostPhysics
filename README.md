AlmostPhysics
=============

A simple discrete-time particle simulator filled with whatever silliness I feel like.


This project depends on jFreeChart (http://www.jfree.org/jfreechart/download.html) to run. You'll have to download it and make sure eclipse/java uses them in the build path. Otherwise, you should be good to go.
