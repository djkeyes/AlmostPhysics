AlmostPhysics
=============

A simple discrete-time particle simulator filled with whatever silliness I feel like.


This project depends on [jFreeChart](http://www.jfree.org/jfreechart/download.html) to run (I'm using version 1.0.17). You'll have to download it and make sure it's added to the eclipse build path. Otherwise, you should be good to go.

For convenience, I've pushed the eclipse .project, .classpath, and .settings/org.eclipse.jdt.core.prefs files to this repo--compatibility over multiple devlopment environments is not a priority. If you're downloading this library to run on your own, these settings could conflict with your current eclipse settings, so keep that in mind.
